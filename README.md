# C# Challenges Repository

This repository contains two C# challenges: a Base64 encoder/decoder and a Caesar cipher cipher/decipher.

## Base64 Converter

### Description
The Base64 converter allows you to encode and decode text to and from Base64 format.

### Usage
1. Select the action you want to perform:
   - 1: Encode
   - 2: Decode
   - 3: Return to main menu

2. Provide the path of the file you want to encode/decode.

## Caesar Cipher Converter

### Description
The Caesar cipher converter enables you to cipher and decipher text using the Caesar cipher algorithm. You will need to provide a key for the operation.

### Usage
1. Select the action you want to perform:
   - 1: Cipher
   - 2: Decipher
   - 3: Return to main menu

2. Provide the path of the file you want to cipher/decipher.

3. Also provide the key for the operation.
